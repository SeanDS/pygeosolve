Welcome to pygeosolve's documentation!
======================================

`pygeosolve` can be used to compute solutions to geometrical constraint problems.

Basic usage
***********

The basic classes you will need to perform a geometric constraint problem are shown below:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   geometry/index
   parameters/index
   constraints/index

Solutions
*********

A solution can be computed by calling `solve`.
