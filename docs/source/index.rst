pygeosolve: a simple geometric constraint solver for Python
===========================================================

Pygeosolve is a simple and easy to use geometric constraint solver for Python. It solves
constraint problems involving lines and points using SciPy's `optimization package
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html>`__.

Pygeosolve is a basic library providing users with a bit of fun while experimenting with
primitive shapes and constraints. It is nowhere near as powerful as a professional CAD
package, though, so anyone wishing to solve complicated problems might instead consider
something like `SolveSpace <https://solvespace.com/>`__.

.. warning::

   Pygeosolve is experimental software, and will likely remain so forever. It is not
   recommended to use it as part of Python code you intend to distribute.
